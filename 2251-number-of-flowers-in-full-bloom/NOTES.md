The time complexity of the provided code is O((m + n) log m), where 'm' is the number of flowers and 'n' is the number of people.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Sorting start_time and end_time :  O(m log m) - Sorting each of the arrays containing start times and end times.
2. Binary search operations inside the loop :  O(n log m) - For each person, performing binary search on both start_time and end_time.

Combining these, the dominant term is the sorting step, so the overall time complexity is O((m + n) log m).
